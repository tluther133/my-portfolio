  <p>A perfect family vacation combines energy with recovery. I found both. For all the organising mothers when they developed the Beach Club. My favourite part of the Kid’s Club is the staff. How they maintain their energy levels all day long with activities galore ( and by galore, I mean copious…. whether water geared or dry land, no child can claim boredom with the amount of options available).
