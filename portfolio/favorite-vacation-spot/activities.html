  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>Turtle Bay is home to a vast array of activites, making anyone visiting the place physically incapable of claiming boredom.</p>
  <h2>Bird Watching</h2>

  <p>The Watamu–Malindi area is extremely rich for it’s diversity of birds. Over 450 species have been recorded within 30 km of Watamu, including some rare and little-known species that have made the area known world-wide amongst birders and ornithologists. Since many species of birds are restricted to particular habitat types, a major reason for this diversity around Watamu and Malindi is the wide range of habitats that occur within the area.</p>
  <h1>Deep Sea Fishing</h1>

  <p>An angler's dream of watching the leaping antics of a hooked sailfish or the struggle with a huge marlin and other monsters from the deeps can become a reality when fishing out from Turtle Bay. Offshore is offered some of the best of Africa's big game sport for a host of species while the Beach Club makes a perfect base from which to operate, and to relax between the rigorous sessions.</p>
  <p>Fishes encountered include Black, Blue and Striped Marlin, Sailfish, Broadbill, Tiger, Hammerhead and Bull Sharks, Wahoo, Kingfish, Greater Trevally, Cobia, Yellowfin Tuna, Dorado, Grouper, Red, Ruby and other Snappers along with many other smaller species.</p>
  <p>With departure at 6 a.m., leave the hotel beach around dawn turn left and a short walk will find the captain on the sands by Ocean Sports where a small boat is ready to take the party to the game vessel. Discuss with the captain as to the preferences for species and personal fishing experience. This is invaluable when it comes to striking and hooking.</p>
  <h1>Excursions</h1>

  <p>Discover the huge variety of marine life in Africa’s first marine park, Watamu National Marine Park. They offer the only guided snorkel trip with Richard Bennett, an Oxford zoologist with 20 years of experience in the park. Richard will give you a briefing before you leave, polish up your snorkelling skills and show you the multicoloured bounty of the Coral Gardens. Includes; guide, glass-bottom boat, mask and snorkel, marine park fees. Departure - at low tides.</p>
  <p>Experience Kenya’s own Grand Canyon! After a scenic drive through Malindi, over the Sabaki River Bridge and through rural villages, enjoy the views of this naturally eroded landscape. Descend into the “Kitchen” with a local guide who will point out strange features carved by wind and rain; a map of Africa, a rhino head and a sacred worship site.</p>
  <p>Explore the Old Swahili Town of Mombasa. Visit the 16th Century Fort Jesus, much fought over by the Portuguese and Arabs, followed by town drive to the Mombasa Tusks and old harbour. Visit the famous Bamburi Nature Trail. This amazing habitat has been restored from a cement factory and is now home to giraffes, hippos, waterbuck and other wildlife! Finish off at Bombolulu Workshop for crafts made by the physically handicapped. Optional seafood lunch at the Tamarind Restaurant overlooking Mombasa and Nyali Creek.</p>
  <p>Experience the mangroves of Mida from a completely new angle – from tree canopy level! An exciting suspended walkway leads you 260 metres through a progression of mangrove species. A qualified Mida Creek Guide will highlight the natural history of the mangroves and the creek. The Bird Hide offers expansive views across the creek and at certain high tides a stunning view of hundreds of wading birds. Your visit to Mida Mangrove Walkway will help both the local community and the conservation of Mida as Ksh 100 from your trip will be donated to the local ASSETS secondary school fund.</p>
  <p>The town of Gede was curiously abandoned hundreds of years ago. The reason for this sudden departure is shrouded in mystery…These extensive ruins and on-site museum provide a fascinating glimpse of life in an African-Arab town hundreds of years ago.</p>
  <p>The nearby Kipepeo Butterfly Project gives an insight into the rare wildlife of Arabuko-Sokoke Forest and the lives of local butterfly farmers. Experience this exciting community conservation project from the butterfly house exhibition.</p>
  <h1>Snorkelling</h1>

  <p>If a guest wishes to snorkel in front of the hotel, snorkels and goggles are available for use at the Funbase shop located near the swimming pool.</p>
  <p>If a guest wishes to visit the Coral Gardens in a boat where the highest density of fish can be found but without a professional guide, the Hotel hires a glass-bottomed boat from the local Watamu Association of Boat Owners twice a week. The excursion fee paid to the Hotel by the guest covers all boat and ticket costs.</p>
  <p>Turtle Bay Beach Club operates its own glass-bottomed boat on an excursion to the Coral Gardens every day except Mondays. Guests are given an introductory lecture about the Marine Park and what they are likely to see before being taken to the Gardens in the hotel boat.</p>
