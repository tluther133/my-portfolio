  <p>One of my favorite vacation spots has to be Turtle Bay. The view, the location, the staff; almost everything just hits differently. Personally, I would recommend this to anyone who would like a memorable experience in the coastal region.</p>
  Turtle Bay actively participates in the Watamu-Marine-Association, which is aimed at helping the local community. For anyone who would like to visit, there is a vast range of activities in the resort. Click here to learn more about Turtle Bay.</p>
