  <h1>Making Reservations</h1>
  <p>Reserevations can be made in one of two, simple ways:</p>
  <h2>TripAdvisor</h2>
  <p>TripAdvisor is a site used to rate, review and make reservations. We highly recommend this since it shows our opening and closing hours in real time. It also shows rooms available, and the best prices for our facilities.</p>
  <h2>Direct Contact</h2>
  <p>On our contact info page, we have posted contacts to reach out to us, to make a reservation or leave a suggestion.</p>
