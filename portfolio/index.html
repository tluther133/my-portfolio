  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <div class="Unimportant">
  <p>I studied at Chavakali High School in Chavakali, Vihiga County. Currently, I have no work experience whatsoever, that which I am hoping to fix very soon.</p>
  <p>I decided to take a class on programming because it is a useful skill that is becoming more relevant as the years progress. Given the current pandemic, I perceived having programming skills would give me the upper hand in today's economy, and I saw Moringa School as a way to achieve my goal.</p>
  <p>I am interested in politics, automobiles and programming mostly.</p>
